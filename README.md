# data-visualization
This is a data visualization digital management dashboard using Echarts and HTML, and I utilized the combination of Flexible.js + rem to make it adaptable to screen changes. The website has been deployed using Netlify, and the website's address is: https://glistening-malabi-732972.netlify.app/
#Features
This website consists of the following sections:
1) A chip image with animated effects serves as the background, and the chip's data is displayed on corresponding nodes, with the data capable of dynamic changes.
2) Six charts displaying different data, including line charts, pie charts, and bar charts. All of these charts are created using the Echarts API, and they feature animation effects and user interactivity. This approach to data presentation is more intuitive and easier to understand. All data can be dynamically updated by retrieving it from a database.
3) A continuously upward-scrolling event list that automatically returns to the top and starts scrolling again when it reaches the bottom can be achieved using CSS and JavaScript to ensure smooth animation transitions.
